couriersrs 0.1.2
================

No functional changes. Just including a patch from Hanno BÃ¶ck
<hanno@gentoo.org> in configure.ac.


couriersrs 0.1.1
================

Fixed handling of empty sender addresses in forward operation mode.
couriersrs did not accept such mails in version 0.1.0. They are now
forwarded by keeping the empty sender address.
